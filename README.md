🕒 Python Clock ProjectThis Python project is an interactive time-management application. It displays time in a hh:mm:ss format, allowing users to synchronize with the system clock, manually set a starting time, and configure an alarm.📋 FeaturesSystem Clock Mode: Automatically fetches and starts the clock from your computer's current time.Manual Setting: Allows users to input a custom start time using a tuple (hours, minutes, seconds).Alarm System: A dedicated function to set a "wake-up" time. The program triggers a message when the clock matches the alarm tuple.Dynamic Updates: Real-time updates every second with precise logic for time carry-overs (60s $\rightarrow$ 1min, 60min $\rightarrow$ 1h).Tuple-Based Logic: All time data is stored and manipulated as immutable tuples to ensure data integrity.🛠️ How It WorksThe program follows a modular structure controlled by a Main Menu:Initialize: The user chooses between System Time or Manual Entry.The Loop: The program enters a while True loop.Display: Formats the tuple into a readable string (e.g., 16:30:00).Check: Compares the current time tuple to the alarm tuple.Wait: Pauses for 1 second using time.sleep(1).Calculate: Deconstructs the tuple, increments the second, manages carries, and reconstructs a new tuple.
